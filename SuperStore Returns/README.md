# File Title: 2023.12.03.Project5.TB

This was the fifth project that I worked on in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was an independent project designed to showcase what I have learned for Tableau Story Telling. The purpose was to prepare an analysis for the CEO of Superstore to help them understand what is causing customers to return their orders and how to reduce the volume of returned orders

#### Data
The data was one Excel spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen:
- `'Superstore.xls'`: each row corresponds to one product sold; sheets were LEFT JOIN'd
    - `'orders'`: details all fields for each ordered item
    - `'returns'`: details all fields for each returned item

#### Description:
- 9-page Tableau Visualization and Presentation
- Includes data analysis, charts, dashboard, and stories

#### Assumptions:
- Profits from sales are totaling in the negative.	
- There is one or more causes for negative profits directly related to orders and returns.
- The operations department will need to make changes.

#### Process:
I first joined the sheets.
Then I analyzed data using visualizations to determine what is causing returns.
I built a dashboard for monitoring returns.
Lastly, I created a Tableau story to present my findings.

#### Findings:
1. Returned purchases are the leading cause of declining profits at Superstore.
2. There is a positive correlation between sales and returns.
3. The technology category has the largest return rate.
4. There are several customers who have a return rate of 100%.
5. Each state had different rates of return for different sub-categories.
6. Orders made throughout the year had higher return rates depending on the month.
7. Return rates do not correlate with the amount of product sold, some of the lowest-selling products had a return rate of 100%.

#### Notes for Reviewer:
As requested I provided 3 potential LoFi mockups and a template image of the dashboard with empty containers in the ZIP file and a stories draft in the Tableau file.
